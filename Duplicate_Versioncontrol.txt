Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 
 Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled,
 though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.
We have various version control techniques, 1)Local version control 2) Centralized version control 3)Distributed version control
